## Resistors In Parallel
To find the equivalent resistance for resistors in parallel we refer to this equation:

$\frac{1}{R_eq} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_n}$

We know that $R = \frac{V}{I}$, this is from [[Ohms Law]] $V = I \cdot R$
And we can use the equivalent resistance formular to then find current in each resistor
Furthermore we know : $$ V_{total} = V_1 = V_2 = V_3 ... $$
Therefore the voltage at the 3 ohm resistor is 18 / 3 = 6
$$R = \frac{V}{I} \therefore 3 = \frac{18}{I}$$

$I_1 = 6$
$I_2 = 3$
$I_3 = 2$

The formula for Power is $$ P = V \cdot I $$
And $$P = I^2 \cdot R$$

The power delivered to each resistor is then; 
$P_1 = 6^2 \cdot 3 = 108 W$
$P_2 = 18 \cdot 3 = 54W$ 
$P_3 = 18 \cdot 2 = 36W$ 

**Find the equivalent resistance first**
The total power is $P = \frac{V^2}{R} \therefore P = \frac{18^2}{R_eq}$

## Junctions and Multiple Loops

>This man is plotting on giving us a lot of questions on loops

### The Branch Rule

The current in a multiloop circuit is the same thought the branch this is the branch rule

### Kirchhoff's Junction Rule
**The sum of currents entering a junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction**
This is equated as $I_1 = I_2 + I_3 ....$

## Single Loop Circuits

### Energy Conservation Law
The energy conservation law tells us the energy gained by electrons moving is dispersed as other forms in the load.
