The existence of potential difference on a conductor creates an electric field. This electric field influences the electrons in the material to move in one direction, this flow of electrons due to the voltage difference at the ends of the conductor is referred to as current.

## Electric Current
*Current (I) is the rate of flow of charge per unit time.*
*Current is measured Amperes*

$I = \frac{Q}{T}$
$I = Cs^-1$
I is measured in Coulombs per Second Alternatively Amps

## The Current Continuity Principle

When the potential difference in a conductor at it's terminals is constant then we refer to this as the steady state.
The current continuity principle states that in a single loop circuit that is in a steady state the current will remain the same across the circuit unless there is a sink or a source.

## Electron Drift Velocity 
Drift velocity is the average velocity of free electrons moving in a conductor under the influence of an electric current.

$$ I = nAqV_d$$

$$ \therefore V_d = \frac{I}{nAq}$$

This means that $V_d$ is measured in $m/s^-1$
n represents the number of electrons passing a certain point
A is Area
q is Charge 
The number of electrons passing a certain point can also be calculated as $n = \frac{Q}{e}$
*Keeping in mind that the Q represents Charge and e is Elementary Charge*
*Elementary Charge is 1.60 * 10^-19

Energy is given as $E = VIT$
